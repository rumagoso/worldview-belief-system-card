# WBSC Implementation Examples

This directory contains example WBSC implementations for real AI systems.

## Current Examples
- [Claude (Anthropic)](./claude-example.yaml) - Constitutional AI approach
- [GPT-4 (OpenAI)](./gpt4-example.yaml) - RLHF safety framework  
- [Llama 2 (Meta)](./llama2-example.yaml) - Open source model

These are estimates based on publicly available information. Actual implementations would require direct company input.

## Contributing Examples
We welcome additional examples! Please:
1. Base estimates on publicly documented approaches
2. Use the standard WBSC format
3. Include transparency score justifications
4. Clearly mark as estimates vs official declarations
