# WBSC Implementation Examples

This directory contains example WBSC implementations for real AI systems.

## Current Examples
- [Claude (Anthropic)](./claude-example.yaml) - Constitutional AI approach
- [GPT-4 (OpenAI)](./gpt4-example.yaml) - RLHF safety framework  
- [Llama 2 (Meta)](./llama2-example.yaml) - Open source model

These are estimates based on publicly available information (*).

## Contributing Examples
We welcome additional examples! Please:
1. Base estimates on publicly documented approaches
2. Use the standard WBSC format
3. Include transparency score justifications
4. Clearly mark as estimates vs official declarations

## (*) Notes on the initial examples
## Transparency Score Differences
- Claude: Higher scores due to extensive Constitutional AI documentation and explicit ethical frameworks
- GPT-4: Moderate transparency with some procedural details but less philosophical clarity
- Llama 2: Lower overall but higher on limitations due to open-source nature enabling external validation

## Real-World Application
These examples show how existing LLMs might implement WBSC declarations based on their current approaches. Actual implementations would require direct input from the companies and more detailed technical specifications.

## Improvement Opportunities
All three examples show room for higher transparency scores, particularly in cultural pluralism and detailed procedural documentation - demonstrating the value of the WBSC standard for driving better disclosure.
