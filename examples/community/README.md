# Community WBSC Implementation Examples

Welcome to the community-driven collection of Worldview Belief System Card (WBSC) implementations! This directory showcases real-world applications of the WBSC framework contributed by researchers, developers, organizations, and AI ethics practitioners from around the world.

## üåç About Community Examples

The community examples demonstrate the versatility and global applicability of the WBSC framework across diverse domains, cultural contexts, and implementation approaches. Unlike the standardized [enterprise examples](../enterprise/), these submissions reflect the unique perspectives, challenges, and innovations of the global AI ethics community.

### Why Community Examples Matter
